The following is the learning a.k.a review roadmap I designed during the AI explosion in Q3 2024. It was also when GPT became smarter, and I was constantly using AI tools to adjust and refine my skill tree.

I have received support from many seniors in various places, and there are too many people to thank. I will gradually add acknowledgments after confirming with the individuals involved. Of course, I also need to thank god, haha!

One of the main reasons I love software development and system design - perhaps the only reason - is that our environment is relatively open and friendly. Most of the time, many seniors are very willing to answer questions - as long as you don't ask stupid questions without doing your homework.

I really like the concept of this virtuous cycle. It's because we've been through the rain that we're willing to hold an umbrella for others.
