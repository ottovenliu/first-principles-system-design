# Day 2-1 | Requirements Confirmation × System Design Starting Point (1): Transformation of Business Logic

Before any system starts running, we more or less have a primary business purpose that we want to achieve.

Even for the simplest one-page official website or advertising page, its purpose of existence is to: **quickly let people get information**.

Therefore, before we carry out our system design, we must actively participate in every requirement confirmation and meeting content synchronization, so that we can have a rough but clear concept of the system we are about to design and develop from the very beginning.

## The Ontology of Business Logic: From Phenomenon to Essence

### Three Levels of Requirements

**Phenomenon Level**: What the user says

- "I want a software that can track logistics"
- "I need real-time tracking, no delays"
- "I want to monitor the situation at home at any time"

**Essence Level**: The real motivation behind the demand

- The desire for time control
- Anxiety and control over risks
- The assumption and sharing of responsibility

**Existence Level**: The state of life changed by the system

- From passive waiting to active control
- From uncertainty to predictability
- From individual responsibility to collective collaboration

### Code as the Embodiment of Metaphysics

Code is a concrete tool that turns abstract business logic into concrete rules through code. Just as we cannot directly describe the abstract "justice", we can turn it into practical rules of conduct through legal provisions.

This process is "philosophical abstraction and reduction":

- **Abstraction**: Extracting the core intentionality from the user's words
- **Modeling**: Describing the essence of the business with domain concepts
- **Reduction**: Making the system truly operate through architectural services

This is also the most important and very worthy ability for modern engineers to learn - **a sense of excellence**, how to slowly unravel abstract concepts into a magnificent tapestry.

Of course, our discussions are always beautiful.
Among engineers, algorithms and data types are like our Tower of Babel, establishing a basic environment for smooth communication.

However, non-programmers do not understand this language. Even the requirement specification clarification documents generated by AI will have technical considerations that are not taken into account in some of the trade-offs behind them.

This kind of vague space is undoubtedly driving us crazy. A vague request is no less than a priest in a temple suddenly saying "the gods need you to offer courage".
There are many types of courage, a grand gladiator feast, a triumphant conquest victory, an Olympic laurel, and even admitting the thoughts in one's heart. So what should we do, how do we know what our gods **really** need?

So we need the philosophical thinking context of Domain-Driven Design.

## DDD: The Cognitive Framework of Domain-Driven

### Why Do We Need Domain Thinking?

Eric Evans emphasized in "Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software": Engineers should not only pursue the elegance of code, the most important thing is a deep understanding of business logic.

But what is "business logic"? From a phenomenological point of view, every business has its **intentionality** - it points to a specific purpose and way of realizing value.

**The intentionality of an investment trading system**: The ultimate control of time
**The intentionality of a family financial system**: The coordinated management of collective resources
**The intentionality of a health monitoring system**: The continuous cognition of physical state

### The Philosophical Foundation of Domain Modeling

Each domain has its unique **ontological structure**:

```py
Domain Ontology
├── Entities - Core concepts with identity
├── Value Objects - Descriptive attributes
├── Aggregates - Consistency boundaries
└── Domain Events - The meaning of state changes
```

This is not just a technical pattern, but also a cognitive tool for understanding the essence of business.

## Event Storming: Making Business Phenomena Visible

### Seeing the Temporality of Business from Events

The core insight of Event Storming: **Business is essentially a sequence of events in time**.

Traditional requirements analysis asks "what should the system do", while Alberto Brandolini, the inventor of Event Storming, points out another important question: "what happened and why is it important".

**The interaction between objects is based on the occurrence of events, and the occurrence of events causes differences in object data.**

This is a very important concept, because the principle of the existence of data is because of the change of information (info), and the reason why the change of information (info) is recorded as data is to **realize an abstract business logic**.

It is precisely because of this that Alberto Brandolini emphasizes the correlation of each event and discusses the application requirements of events and events.

### Practical Framework: Phenomenological Event Storming (Stock Trading Scenario)

**Step 1: Identify Significant Events**
Not only record "order created", but also understand "what this event means to the user":

- For control-oriented users: The plan begins to be executed
- For social-oriented users: The expectation is about to be met
- For security-oriented users: The commitment is officially effective

**Step 2: Explore the Intentionality of Events**
What is the motivation behind each event?

- "Price warning triggered" → Anxiety about loss
- "Budget overrun alarm" → Fear of losing control
- "Device offline notification" → Concern about responsibility

**Step 3: Map to Technical Implementation**
Determine the technical strategy based on the intentionality of the event:

- Anxiety-driven events require low latency (WebSocket + Lambda@Edge)
- Fear-driven events require reliability (SQS + DLQ + Retry)
- Concern-driven events require observability (CloudWatch + SNS)

## Requirements Ontology: MBTI as an Analysis Tool

### Why Choose MBTI?

MBTI is not just a psychological test, but a **classification system of cognitive models**. It helps us understand how different users perceive the world, make decisions, and organize their lives.
I think MBTI is a useful tool for scenario segmentation, mainly because it is based on:

- Extroversion or Introversion (E/I)
- Sensing or Intuition (S/N)
- Thinking or Feeling (T/F)
- Judging or Perceiving (J/P)

These four quadrants are also the major directions in which we make decisions.

I believe there must be other personality analysis tools and more professional marketing role-playing profiles, but for now, let's try to simulate the situations we may encounter in life as simply and comprehensively as possible.

**Technical Correspondence of the Four Cognitive Dimensions**:

| Cognitive Dimension | System Design Impact |
| --- | --- |
| E/I (Energy Direction) | Collaboration vs. Personalization |
| S/N (Information Processing) | Concrete vs. Abstract |
| T/F (Decision Making) | Efficiency vs. Experience |
| J/P (Lifestyle) | Structure vs. Flexibility |

### In-depth Analysis of Six Typical Cases

---

#### Case 1: Investment Trading System [I-N-T-J] - Control-oriented Demand

**Phenomenon Level**: "I'm afraid I'll lose money if the speed is not fast enough"
**Essence Level**: The ultimate demand for time control
**Existence Level**: From a passive recipient of the market to an active time manager

**Event Storming Analysis**:
Market data update → Price analysis trigger → Trading decision generation →
Order submission → Trade confirmation → Position update → Risk recalculation

The delay of each event may trigger anxiety, so it requires:

- **Extremely low latency**: WebSocket + Lambda@Edge + ElastiCache
- **Data consistency**: DynamoDB Transactions
- **Fast fault recovery**: Multi-AZ + Auto Failover

---

#### Case 2: Family Financial System [E-N-T-J] - Coordination-oriented Demand

**Phenomenon Level**: "Let the family record together to avoid budget imbalance"
**Essence Level**: Coordination and control of collective responsibility
**Existence Level**: From personal financial management to a family governance system

**Core Event**: "Budget boundary is touched"

- This event means "control is challenged" for ENTJ users
- The system must immediately provide a path to "regain control"
- Technical implementation: SNS real-time notification + Lambda automatic permission adjustment

---

#### Case 3: Health Monitoring System [I-S-T-J] - Certainty Demand

**Phenomenon Level**: "Want to know in time whether the body data is synchronized correctly"
**Essence Level**: The continuous need for confirmation of physical state
**Existence Level**: From passive worry about health to active monitoring

**Key Insight**: What users care about most is not the data itself, but "the reliability of the data"

- **Data integrity** is more important than real-time
- **Visibility of synchronization status** is more important than feature richness
- Technical implementation: IoT Core + Timestream + CloudWatch Dashboards

---

#### Case 4: Smart Home Monitoring System [I-S-T-P] - Adaptability Demand

**Phenomenon Level**: "Monitor smart devices at any time to ensure the safety of the elderly and children, and can accept occasional delays"
**Essence Level**: Flexible balance in assuming responsibility
**Existence Level**: Role transformation from a worrier to a guardian

**Core Contradiction Analysis**: "Monitor at any time" vs. "Accept delays"

- Daily status monitoring can be delayed (**cost optimization**)
- Emergency events must be real-time (**responsibility bottom line**)
- Technical implementation: IoT Device Management + Kinesis + Lambda + SNS

---

#### Case 5: Parcel Tracking System [I-S-T-P] - Transparency Demand

**Phenomenon Level**: "Track parcel progress in real time, occasional errors are acceptable"
**Essence Level**: The gentle need for control over uncertainty
**Existence Level**: From passive waiting to active knowing

**Philosophical Comparison with Case 4**:
Both are ISTP, but the degree of responsibility is different:

- Case 4: Assuming the heavy responsibility for the safety of others
- Case 5: Managing the light responsibility of personal expectations

This difference directly affects the fault tolerance strategy of the system design:

- Home monitoring requires a backup mechanism
- Parcel tracking can be gracefully degraded

**The "Philosophy of Waiting" in Event Storming**:
Parcel shipment → Status synchronization → Location update →
Anomaly detection → Expectation adjustment → Delivery confirmation

The core event is "expectation adjustment" rather than "status update"

- ISTP users can face delays rationally, as long as the information is transparent
- "Acceptable error" means that the system's honest notification is more important than perfect performance

**Honesty Design of Technical Implementation**:

- API Gateway: Integrate multi-party data sources
- DynamoDB: Traceable records of state changes
- EventBridge: Graceful handling of asynchronous updates
- CloudWatch: Transparency of system health

---

#### Case 6: Travel Sharing Platform [E-N-F-P] - Creative Demand

**Phenomenon Level**: "Record travel inspiration at any time, share route maps and transportation"
**Essence Level**: The desire for creative expression and social connection
**Existence Level**: The sublimation from personal experience to shared value

**Technical Challenges of the ENFP Cognitive Model**:

- **E (Extroversion)**: Requires real-time sharing and interaction mechanisms
- **N (Intuition)**: Inspiration is instantaneous and requires barrier-free recording
- **F (Feeling)**: Values emotional resonance over functional perfection
- **P (Perceiving)**: Content forms are variable, and the structure needs to be adaptable

**Event Storming of the Creative Process**:
Inspiration trigger → Content capture → Context tagging →
Creative processing → Sharing and publishing → Community interaction → Inspiration regeneration

**Key Insight**: The design philosophy of a creative system

- **Capture is better than organization**: Record first, organize later
- **Expression is better than perfection**: Being able to publish is more important than having complete functions
- **Connection is better than content**: Social value is higher than information value

**AWS's Creative Support Architecture**:

- S3: Unlimited storage of multimedia content
- AppSync: Real-time collaboration for social interaction
- Cognito: Community foundation for identity authentication
- Location Service: Contextualization of geographic tagging
- Offline synchronization: Inspiration is not lost due to network

## Transformation of Business Logic - Phenomenon x Essence x Existence

Through today's philosophical analysis, we have successfully transformed vague user expressions into clear functional requirements. But this is only the first step.

When we start to design a specific AWS architecture, we will find that there are deeper problems:

- What does "real-time" mean in terms of milliseconds of delay?
- How much concurrency does "monitor at any time" need to support?
- What does "cannot fail" mean in terms of nines of availability?
- What is the budget ceiling for "controllable cost"?

These are **non-functional requirements** - they determine the technical specifications of the system and the specific configuration of AWS services.

Tomorrow we will discuss "Domain Boundaries and Basic Requirements Confirmation", and have an in-depth discussion on the philosophical basis of technical specifications such as API design, capacity planning, and disaster recovery strategies.

## Today's Cognitive Framework

- **The Ontology of Business Logic**: A three-layer analysis from phenomenon to essence to existence
- **The Cognitive Value of DDD**: Domain models as a tool for business understanding
- **The Temporality of Event Storming**: Seeing the intentionality of business in events
- **The Technical Mapping of MBTI**: The cognitive model of core users determines the choice of architecture

Remember: The core ability of an architect is not to memorize the list of AWS services, but to understand "why users need this system". Technology is just a means to achieve goals, and the human needs behind the goals are the philosophical basis of design.
